Steps to follow :
 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis - trend plot of all parameters, relation with ams (scatter plot, BOX PLOT of all), variations of each parameters value
2. Data Cleaning
3. Missing Data imputation (one technique)
4. Feature Selection (Try different techniques- find the common ones)
5. Train data and test data split 
6. Prediction - Naive Bayes, Random Tree, ANN, SVM
(Logistic Regression If possible)
7. Accuracy Metrics of the Model
8. Python Dashboard
